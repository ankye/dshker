# Changelog

## 0.1.28 — Unreleased

- A computer that was already online in the network device directory now also
  appears in the Run route’s “+ / 添加远程工作台” picker. Membership was only
  recorded on the first device restore of a Launcher session, so a computer that
  joined the network later stayed invisible — and had no fixed Run tab — until
  the Launcher was restarted. Membership is now re-read with the pairing list and
  on the background session sweep.

- Starting DSH Web no longer fails blindly when its fixed port is still held by
  a leftover DSH Web process, e.g. one left behind by an earlier crash or by a
  manual development launch. The Launcher detects the holder before spawning,
  stops a residual instance it recognizes as its own, and only refuses with a
  clear “port in use” message when another program holds the port.

## 0.1.27 — 2026-09-11

- Fixed the macOS application icon package so Finder and Applications display
  the complete multi-layer DSHKer icon instead of a broken or blurry fallback.

- Updating a managed plugin now converges its Launcher-owned clone to the
  fetched revision before checkout. Build residue can no longer brick an
  extension update or surface as a misleading core-launch failure.

- Fixed a blank Run page after the P2P security hardening. Electron 42 reports
  an omitted WebView session partition as an empty string; the strict policy
  now admits only that exact platform representation while continuing to reject
  arbitrary partition labels.

- Remote workspaces are created on demand. Run starts with Local only; click
  “+” and choose a computer from the LAN or SSH list to create and focus its
  non-closable tab. The picker is a bounded floating panel that lists ready
  workspaces first and keeps unavailable ones visible but disabled with their
  real status.
